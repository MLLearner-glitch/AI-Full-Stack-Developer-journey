# Day 19 - CSS Forms
This project demonstrates of my practice of CSS Forms as oart of my AI Full Stack Developer Journey.

## Topics I Covered
### 1 CSS Forms
In CSS Forms some commonly used CSS properties for styling input fields are:
 - width
 - padding
 - border
 - border-radius
 - background-color
 - color
 - font-size
 - margin

 ### 2 CSS Units
Used different CSS units to build responsive layouts:

- `px` – fixed sizing  
- `%` – flexible widths  
- `rem` – scalable spacing  
- `vh` / `vw` – viewport-based sizing  

 Helps in creating **responsive designs**

### 3 CSS Inheritance
Demonstrated how child elements inherit styles from parent elements.

Examples:
- `color`
- `font-family`

 Reduces repeated CSS and improves readability

---

### 4 CSS Specificity
Explained how CSS decides **which rule is applied** when multiple rules target the same element.

Order of priority:
```
Inline > ID > Class > Element
```

 Very important **interview concept**

---

### 5 Website Layout (Flexbox)
Built a basic website layout using **Flexbox**:

- Header
- Sidebar
- Main content

 Flexbox is widely used in modern web development
